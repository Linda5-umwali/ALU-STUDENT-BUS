# ALU-STUDENT-BUS
28th july 2025,
The main task is to create a useful app and showcase skills acquired. Thats why I propose the idea of ALU student Bus Service.
This will be used to inform us who use the school bus to come to school.
This will be doing the following:
.Letting people check-in when they get in the bus in the morning, to help track the number of people who are in the bus till it is full.
.It will show the current location of the bus to let people know when to get to the bus stops we usually stop at. 
.It will show the bus on map, to let people know the exact time when it will reach their spot.

Problems I'm hoping this will solve.
.leaving people behing because of mis-information of where the bus is.
.As the number of the users is increasing everyday as people are knowing about this new bus that started operating, It is leaving people behind because it get filled when we haven't even reached Zindiro((one of the bus stops), This could help a direct schedule of the secong roung to get everyone.
.I hope to help fix the issue of poor time managent by providing exact time the bus will come and the expected time it will reach it's destination using map and traffic tracking.
